## Frame
This component has two versions, it is mainly designed for holding and fixing all the needed components and parts for the project. Strew's nut should be fixed on it. 

## Gear
This is connnect to the step motor. It works to transmit force from step motor to the strew and then rotate the object. "gear, step motor v2" is the second version of it. The second version has longer teeth, which solve the problem of spinning between two gears. 

## Strew Gear
This is design to fix with the strew we bought. The step motor will transmit force through step motor gear to make the strew rotate. 

## Connection
This components is design to hold the step motor and connect strew with the step motor. This connection should move up or down with the strew and step motor as rotating, but it should not rotate with the strew. In this way, the step motor can generate the strew to move up and rotate. 

## Coverage Frame
This component is designed to hold our sensor. the rectangle part is use to connect with the frame. It is a seperate part from the frame because of the limited space for the 3D printer. 

## Rail Base
This is design for the 2-D experiment. It works with the step motor and generate the sensor to move in a straight line. 

## Plate
This object connects to the strew directly. It rotates with the strew and hold the object we are going to scan. 

### Attention
In order to connect different components will. I suggest to print the coverage frame with a 1mm-1.5mm larger width, the step motor gear with 1mm longer teeth. It is able to add more teeth for the strew gear. The original strew gear has 20 teeth which is 2.5 times teeth that the step motor gear has. The original one is more convenient for calculating the angular speed of plate.
