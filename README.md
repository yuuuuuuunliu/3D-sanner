# Ultrasound 3D Scanner

This guide outlines the development process of our ultrasound 3D scanner. We will provide resources in this repository that can be used to reproduce the project, as well as data for evaluating the accuracy of the measurement results. The ultrasound 3D scanner utilizes ultrasound ranging to scan real-world objects, capturing the coordinates of various points on their surfaces. By processing the collected data, the scanner generates a three-dimensional model of the object, enabling an accurate digital representation of the object's size and dimensions. This technology holds immense potential for various applications, including but not limited to artifact preservation, educational applications, and reverse engineering. Our project specifically focuses on constructing a low-cost 3D scanner, aiming to make this technology more accessible for everyday use. By providing an affordable solution, we aim to promote the widespread adoption of this technology in everyday life.
